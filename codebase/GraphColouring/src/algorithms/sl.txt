The SL sequential colouring method was first suggested under the original name of "smallest-last". Like the LF method, the SL method is based on the observation that vertices with few neighbours ought to be coloured as late as possible. Owing to a certain refinement in the process of creating sequences of vertices, the SL method does not have certain faults of the LF algorithm, for instance SL optimally colours trees, cycles, unicyclic graphs, wheels and complete bipartite graphs. For planar graphs, the SL method will never use more than 6 colours. 


algorithm SL-Colour(G);
begin
	K = {};
	
	while V \ K != {} do
		append to K the vertex v with the smallest
		degree in the subgraph generated by V \ K;

	for each vertex v in (K inverted)
		give vertex v the smallest possible colour;
end;
